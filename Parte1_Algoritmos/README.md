# Module 1: Basic positioning systems based in radio signals

##About this module
This module introduces location based on radio frequency signals emitted by reference stations. The algorithms, their limitations and exercises based on smartphones or IoT nodes are presented. 

## Chapter descriptions

### Introducción a los sistemas de Posicionamiento, Seguimiento y Localización 

Terminology. Brief history of location systems. Taxonomy

### Positioning based on triangulation

Circular Multilateration. Hyperbolic Multilateration. Multitriangulation

### Estimate based on TOA, RSS and AOA
Basic principles. Estimate based on Time of Arrival (TOA). Estimation based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). Estimation based on Received Signal Level (RSS). Estimation based on Angle of Arrival (AOA). Cramer Rao Limit. Experimentation using a smartphone or an IoT module.

### Parameterized location (Figerprinting)
RF traces. Correlation Databases. RF Fingerprint Pattern Search. Average Location. Experimental Evaluation. Experimenting with Wi-Fi networks
