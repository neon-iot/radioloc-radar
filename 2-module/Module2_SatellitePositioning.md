# Module 2: satellite positioning 

## About this module

This module introduces satellite-based positioning (GNSS). In addition to the basic systems such as GPS or GLONASS, augmentation systems and the fusion of GNSS data with wireless networks are introduced. 

## Module Chapters

### GNSS: Global Navigation Satellite Systems

Basic concepts. Implementation of GNSS networks (GPS, GLONASS, BEIDU/COMPASS, GALILEO). GNSS Augmentation Systems. Fusion of GNSS with data from wireless networks
Precision system experimentation.

### Inertial Positioning

GNSS limitations in people tracking. Inertial systems for tracking people. Orientation Correction
